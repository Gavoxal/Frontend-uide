0	16000	Today, on March 27th, 2026, we are with the engineer Lorena, Gabriel Sarango, Eduardo Pardo and Fernando Castillo to show some progress regarding the project of titling.
16000	20000	So we want to show some of the progress you have made.
20000	34000	We have already finished some things with the interfaces in Figma.
34000	44000	The engineer Wilson helped us with some things regarding the gel diagram, regarding how the basket was.
44000	48000	He also reviewed the front end, but we wanted to see how it was.
48000	50000	We also advanced a little bit of the front end.
50000	53000	There were changes, and I have one version, and Eduardo has another one.
53000	60000	Fernando has another one because he showed us something and changed everything.
60000	62000	So we had to modify some things again.
62000	64000	So this one we have more or less.
64000	65000	Can you open it with the computer?
65000	67000	I'm not using the computer.
67000	69000	I'm going to see if I can use it with the computer.
69000	70000	What is it?
70000	71000	It's the computer.
71000	72000	There it is.
78000	79000	Very good.
81000	88000	So that's how we had it thought with the adjustments and changes that the engineer Wilson gave us.
88000	90000	Version 1 or version 2?
90000	91000	Version 2.
91000	93000	Version 1 we deleted.
93000	95000	Version 1 we already deleted.
95000	98000	It was very childish and had many pastel colors.
99000	106000	They are already aligning the business line of the colors.
110000	117000	O-TAL-Ed would be the view of the administrator or coordinator in this case.
117000	124000	We can see the pending nominations, the review of the requirements, the active projects they have,
124000	131000	the students who are approved for the thesis,
131000	136000	the students who are required to see information about progress,
136000	141000	to see messages and observations about important changes that should be made.
141000	148000	As for the observations that the teacher has,
148000	151000	we have what are the requirements review,
152000	158000	which is separated by students so that they can upload the English certificate,
158000	162000	the professional certificate and the registration certificate.
164000	166000	And we have what are...
171000	173000	Only the promos, right?
173000	175000	Only the promos right now?
175000	177000	Yes, although we already have the black ones.
178000	181000	We also have the list that is designed for the students,
181000	184000	in which when entering the application,
184000	188000	I would send them a message of validation of requirements,
188000	192000	where they can go to load the requirements of the students and send them.
195000	198000	What are the guys going to upload?
198000	204000	The advances can upload the requirements.
204000	206000	The English certificates...
206000	211000	We think of it as optional in case it is necessary to upload something,
211000	215000	but since they told us that it was a manual task,
215000	219000	we leave it as optional in case they upload something and just fill the checklist.
219000	221000	Nothing else.
221000	223000	It is not mandatory to upload anything.
225000	227000	We have the board,
227000	232000	and that is unlocked from the student list,
232000	240000	and from the student who uploads the requirements and is accepted for the thesis,
240000	252000	we have the template to fill the topic, the area of research, the objective, the problem, the scope,
252000	258000	and in case of generating a PDF file that supports your idea,
258000	260000	you load it there and send it.
262000	264000	I like it.
264000	267000	We also have what are the advances,
267000	271000	the follow-up of the advances that are per week, as you mentioned,
271000	275000	from week one the student goes up to the advance,
275000	280000	and in the seventh he can qualify, give an equation,
280000	283000	and the state will be shown in which it is.
283000	285000	Here, Inge, we wanted to ask you a question.
285000	290000	I remember that you in the previous interviews told us that the areas of research are something that you choose.
290000	291000	Yes.
291000	294000	For example, in this case we chose it because we didn't know which one it was,
294000	298000	we chose this one here, as an example of what the areas of research are,
298000	302000	because technically it is a box of choice.
302000	306000	So we chose artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, software development, quality control.
306000	308000	The research lines are already passed on to you.
308000	309000	Yes, good job.
309000	312000	So that you can customize it there.
312000	313000	Yes.
319000	321000	I like the front part.
321000	322000	Front?
322000	323000	Yes.
323000	325000	That would be the front.
328000	331000	It allows you to see personal information.
331000	333000	Yes, here we have the front.
333000	336000	You know what is missing there?
336000	340000	What would be the court to which the student belongs?
340000	341000	Court?
341000	346000	For example, I can think of 2020-2024.
349000	358000	For example, I would be asked to give me a list of students from the court, I don't know, 2020.
360000	363000	So I would see which one entered in 2020 and that's it.
363000	367000	But this whole section would be, for example, the student section.
367000	371000	So that here you can see the court of 2025 or 2026, for example.
371000	373000	You know that the mesh and court are missing.
373000	381000	Because remember that I have the technology of information in 2019, 2023 and the mesh of information systems.
381000	383000	So there are three meshes.
385000	388000	I have to find them so that they don't explode.
388000	394000	The meshes and that section of, for example, by mesh and by court, wouldn't it be good?
394000	396000	Which mesh does it belong to?
396000	398000	Which career and which mesh?
398000	402000	And that would also be within the student section.
402000	404000	Student and teacher.
404000	406000	Teacher and student.
406000	408000	So those two would be within this.
408000	411000	Yes, that would be within the student section.
411000	418000	To be able to determine, for example, what are the durables of the information technology of the mesh of 2019.
418000	420000	Already.
420000	421000	That's the filter.
421000	422000	And the court.
422000	425000	Does that type of information happen to you?
425000	429000	Mesh of 2019, information technology.
429000	433000	Mesh of 2023, information technology.
436000	441000	2019, information technology engineering.
445000	447000	The other mesh is 2023.
447000	448000	2023.
451000	453000	And the other one is 2025.
455000	457000	Information systems.
457000	459000	Does the number of the career change too?
459000	460000	Yes.
460000	462000	Did the 2023 one change too?
462000	464000	No, it was the same.
465000	467000	These are different meshes.
467000	468000	Okay.
470000	476000	For example, I want to know, for example, all the students who graduated from the 2025 mesh,
476000	479000	that has to be noted for the reports part.
480000	482000	On the side of the direction.
482000	487000	What is the profile? I want the profile of the director.
487000	490000	That was the question we had with this.
490000	493000	Technically, when we think about it, we have...
494000	496000	I don't know.
497000	498000	I put it here.
499000	501000	These are the roles we defined.
501000	502000	Teacher, tutor.
502000	504000	And here I was wrong because it's direction.
504000	505000	Actually, it's not director.
505000	506000	But it's direction.
506000	510000	And it was precisely that this section of what was just what controlled.
510000	513000	Because what I remember we had seen was that they assigned...
513000	517000	The director is fine because it is the normative that is used internally.
517000	518000	Oh, okay.
518000	519000	So I'll leave it like that.
519000	523000	It was that they assigned, for example, the date for their defense.
523000	525000	I still remember it was like your...
525000	527000	And what do I do?
527000	530000	I am the one who authorizes the thesis topics.
532000	536000	I am the one who determines the degree court.
536000	542000	Likewise, the dates of the pre-sustentation and the final support.
543000	549000	Generally, students have a private support and a public one.
550000	556000	And who determines all those dates and everything is the direction.
557000	569020	The engineering or the
569020	574020	I am the one who determines the degree court.
574020	577020	So I am the president of the court in all.
577020	583020	Where can I not be president of the court when I am the thesis director of the student?
583020	587020	There is the role of president of the court.
589020	591020	So it's president of the court and vocals.
591020	593020	So I determine that.
593020	598020	The coordinator, what he does is, for example, go to the court and decide where you are.
598020	601020	That will be the official part.
606020	612020	So, for example, in my view, in my view as a role of direction, I have to say,
612020	617020	I'm going to do the theses, I already have the theses of Eduardo, the theses of Fernando.
617020	621020	So I'm going to decide which is the member of the court.
621020	627020	I can select court one, two in the court, court two, court three, court four.
627020	629020	One, three, two, five.
629020	632020	Member or president, automatically.
632020	633020	How many are there?
633020	637020	Because we have talked to Rodrigo Charly who has helped us and he described us as three roles.
637020	639020	President, court one and court two.
639020	641020	We will leave it totally there.
641020	643020	Okay, good.
643020	648020	And generally the director always goes.
648020	653020	But the director does not put a note, but simply accompanies the student.
653020	656020	He will also defend the director.
656020	661020	And generally it is also for the boys, when you are explaining,
661020	663020	they take the nerves and forget.
663020	667020	Then the director says, no, we did it, it is in the part.
667020	670020	It is also as reinforcement, because sometimes they forget.
670020	679020	And for example, a section within the view of the tutor and what is Darius, that was the name.
679020	680020	The coordinator.
680020	683020	For example, you had thought about it and technically Charly gave us an idea.
683020	686020	For example, they assign sometimes activities.
686020	690020	The co-chair of one of the thesis boys, he takes care of them.
690020	691020	They are not qualified?
691020	695020	All thesis directors, not the coordinator.
698020	699020	The director is you?
699020	701020	The thesis director.
701020	704020	Each thesis has a tutor, let's say.
704020	705020	Yes.
705020	708020	So the tutor is the one who assigns the qualification.
708020	710020	You do not?
710020	711020	Me neither.
711020	713020	But the tutor too.
713020	715020	The tutor also assigns?
715020	716020	Of course.
716020	719020	Because when we talked, they did not explain that they assign tasks,
719020	722020	but as such they are not qualified within the thesis, but they do.
722020	723020	Which thesis?
723020	727020	Charly, that is, you are explaining a little because we are a little lost and within the baccalaureate.
727020	731020	No, no, I am confused.
731020	736020	Each of the tutors, they also have the part.
736020	740020	For example, I am your thesis, you are my director.
740020	743020	Then you tell me, Lorena, today I am going to receive the advance 1.
743020	746020	Then he goes to the advance 1 and qualifies it.
746020	747020	Why?
747020	750020	Because in the end he has to pass a final grade.
750020	755020	Then that final grade is passed to the secretary and they make the assessment to say,
755020	759020	well, Fernando has scored 9.7.
759020	764020	Then the director, who is reviewed, goes to qualify.
764020	766020	They assign a grade.
766020	768020	The director.
768020	769020	And the tutor?
769020	771020	The thesis tutor.
771020	773020	The thesis tutor.
773020	776020	You explained to us that it is a subject.
776020	777020	It is a subject.
777020	778020	You give it.
778020	779020	I give it.
779020	780020	As an integration teacher.
780020	782020	As an integration teacher.
782020	784020	And for example, it would be two totally different activities.
784020	785020	They are two different activities.
785020	786020	And the tutor sends something else.
786020	787020	Oh, ok, ok.
787020	788020	Yes.
788020	790020	Otherwise, I am the new one.
790020	791020	Yes, yes.
791020	793020	Ok, ok, that gives me a little more clarity.
793020	798020	Of course, because then I had thought at first that the tutor simply assigns an activity,
798020	800020	the revision, the re-evaluation, but does not qualify anything.
800020	803020	You have to qualify because if you are studying, you do not do it, I do not know.
803020	807020	But in the end, when you finish, that is, you finish your thesis,
807020	811020	for you to graduate, the director passes me a grade.
811020	815020	That grade is passed to the secretary and it is bounded with all the other qualifications.
815020	817020	Ah, ok, ok.
817020	821020	Well, another question.
821020	826020	And for example, Dario's role as coordinator was not made to be the supervisor.
826020	827020	Yes, he keeps seeing.
827020	831020	For example, what happens is that sometimes with so many things I do not advance to see everything.
831020	834020	So, for example, I already tell you, you help me to follow up on things.
834020	839020	He would enter the system and tells me, for example, look, Eduardo has not presented.
839020	843020	So it is already like an alert and I already do something with everything.
843020	848020	What you have done is to think of it as a view in which Dario as coordinator could see all the records of the same.
848020	849020	He would have to see them.
849020	853020	And that he could comment in case of, for example, see if the tutor assigned something,
853020	856020	he qualified it and be able to do more than anything.
856020	861020	Of course, he, for example, helps me to see when I already have two directors assigned to the thesis,
861020	864020	but these do not meet as guys.
864020	870020	And the guys already start to say, yes, you know what, I do not have the documentation of the director.
870020	873020	And then they come to me and they start to question me.
873020	876020	Ok, ok, that gives me a little more of ...
876020	883020	The truth is that I do not know, do not ask people who do not know much about the process because it confuses you.
883020	888020	No, it's just that we were building a little of the database and it gave us a little idea of ​​some things.
888020	893020	More than anything, then it came to us as an option because we lacked some things of relationship with the database.
893020	896020	So, in addition, it helped us with that, more than with anything else.
896020	897020	It gave us an idea.
897020	899020	But that's it.
899020	901020	I do not know if I have anything else left out there.
901020	902020	But that's the moment we have.
902020	904020	We have ... ah, we advanced ...
905020	907020	This was already designed, we did this.
907020	909020	This was the first version.
909020	912020	Then another one changed, it is the one that Fer has.
912020	917020	In some of the views we already designed some things of how it should be more or less seen.
917020	920020	So, more or less this was how we were working.
920020	928020	And then we went to the version that Fer has with the last thing that Inge Wilson was teaching.
928020	930020	What is that?
930020	936020	It is that at first we were managing HTML with the components MUI.
936020	940020	And then it changed to that everything should be components MUI, including the texts.
940020	942020	And that there should be no HTML.
942020	944020	So, this version here had HTML.
944020	947020	And we changed to the next version.
947020	949020	In addition, we already reviewed the other ones.
949020	951020	It is that now they are using this.
952020	954020	So, more or less, we have the version there.
954020	962020	We are working because we realized that to be able to advance in the project we had to develop absolutely all the necessary components.
962020	968020	And if Fer developed the components and then I developed my components, it would be a disaster.
968020	969020	And it would be a disaster.
969020	970020	Exactly.
970020	975020	So, we better dedicate ourselves to doing a little of all the components and advance a little, a view at least.
975020	981020	So that we can base on that and have the components as a base to do the rest of the views of the other people.
982020	984020	I see it well.
984020	986020	But so far we have more or less.
988020	991020	The backing, we already reviewed it a little like the inge of Tandem Charlie.
991020	993020	He helped us to give two accounts of some errors.
993020	999020	He helped us with the database in some relationships, which is what we have so far.
999020	1001020	There are nine tables.
1001020	1008020	Some relationships were his management, more than anything because of how they were treated.
1008020	1015020	So we ended up having nine tables, among which were the user, the requirements, the committee, the final integrals.
1015020	1017020	Did he review the database of the Wilson?
1019020	1025020	No, he just asked us on Friday, if I remember correctly, to show him all this.
1025020	1033020	So, he did tell us because at first we had seven tables, but it was a typo error that had swallowed some tables.
1033020	1034020	But then ...
1034020	1036020	It can not be, it is impossible that it is.
1036020	1040020	Then I realized, we were reviewing and we lacked the requirements and I did not see them on the table.
1040020	1043020	And I realized that I had forgotten to put them there.
1043020	1046020	But yes, the inge Wilson already reviewed it.
1046020	1050020	We also have to review that to be able to see that.
1050020	1056020	He reviewed this, the database and the interaction with the shager to see how it works.
1056020	1057020	The integration.
1057020	1062020	Also with the users of what they can do and what they can not do.
1062020	1064020	So, up to there we have more or less.
1064020	1070020	And we need to integrate what Charly is teaching us now to leave it as it is.
1070020	1072020	The security part.
1072020	1074020	The security part.
1074020	1077020	They saw that there was no time left and so he was going to review in week 10.
1077020	1078020	Yes, imagine.
1078020	1081020	The truth is that he was going to review in week 10 for a ...
1083020	1087020	But what would not be that the coordinator and director practically have the same role?
1087020	1090020	It could be almost the same.
1090020	1091020	Yes?
1091020	1094020	The exception is that the coordinator does not assign anything.
1094020	1096020	But the director assigns two.
1097020	1101020	He only sees what he does not know because in this case the director does not assign.
1101020	1104020	And he always has to assign the jury, the date, everything.
1104020	1107020	Yes, we are going to manage it as two different roles.
1107020	1113020	But at this time we were going to dedicate ourselves to what we have, the components, and just to ...
1113020	1116020	And remember, we are in week 2.
1116020	1118020	Week 14, I think it is.
1118020	1119020	14?
1119020	1123020	The revision of the project.
1123020	1124020	The project.
1124020	1125020	Well.
1125020	1127020	And we are going to see what happens.
1127020	1128020	Are you in room 4?
1128020	1129020	Room 4.
1131020	1133020	Let's see how the projects are.
1133020	1135020	If they pass the program.
1135020	1141020	The credentials asked us to automatically be set based on the file you upload.
1141020	1142020	Yes.
1142020	1143020	Already.
1144020	1145020	Yes, that's it.
1145020	1146020	So far we have ...
1146020	1149020	With the rest we already have an idea of ​​how we are going to connect it.
1149020	1154020	It would be interesting if you already limit the data with at least two ...
1154020	1161020	Can you pass the data to the guys who already have the email and the complete numbers and the number of the data?
1161020	1162020	It would be good.
1162020	1163020	Besides, we are going to test the program.
1163020	1165020	So that they can already test it with data.
1165020	1167020	Only those of the career.
1167020	1170020	Ok, so we stay here so that they can send us that.
1170020	1172020	The research areas.
1172020	1174020	And I think that's it.
1174020	1176020	That we had to see.
1176020	1177020	No, I think that's it.
1177020	1178020	That's it.
1178020	1179020	Let me write it down.
1179020	1183020	I'm going to do another thing and call you.
1190020	1194020	But can you do the correction for the career data?
1194020	1195020	Yes.
1195020	1196020	Of course.
1196020	1199020	If it were for everything else, it would be more complicated.
1199020	1201020	I'm going to do the correction.
1212020	1214020	It's up like that.
1214020	1216020	That's the one that showed you that it was ...
1216020	1218020	That was the last one I had.
1218020	1220020	I think we can do something with it.
1220020	1225020	I'm going to write it down.
1225020	1227020	I'm going to write it down.
1227020	1229020	So that you can write it down.
1229020	1232020	What is this?
1232020	1234020	The CIDEBAR.
1234020	1238020	The CIDEBAR and the harmonics of the tapes.
1238020	1241020	The harmonics of the tapes.
1241020	1244020	The harmonics of the tapes.
1244020	1247020	Some researches that we did.
1247020	1249020	The functionalities too.
1249020	1251020	You'll see.
1251020	1253020	That's the part of the student that you lost.
1253020	1256020	No, that's the part of the student that I lost.
1256020	1261020	The student was already relating to me, but I already realized.
1264020	1268020	I'm going to see if Ricardo is going to do something else.
1268020	1271020	You'll create the repository for your books.
1271020	1273020	I'll create the one that we get to the house.
1273020	1275020	Yes, because the two of them were mixed.
1275020	1277020	I'll send you the email.
1277020	1280020	I'll send you the email because I put it in another one.
1280020	1282020	I'll send you the email.
1305020	1307020	ming dont keep youtube
1311020	1319620	no
1319620	1321620	I'm going to go to the bathroom.
1333620	1335620	This is the part of the codes.
1335620	1337620	I didn't pass them backwards.
1337620	1339620	Here you can see the code.
1339620	1341620	I don't know if I passed them backwards.
1341620	1343620	I'm going to go to the bathroom.
1347620	1349620	I'm going to the bathroom.
1359620	1361620	Here you can see the codes.
1361620	1363620	You can also take them.
1363620	1365620	Because they are already associated.
1365620	1367620	They are already associated.
1367620	1369620	Look.
1369620	1371620	They are all already associated.
1371620	1373620	We have the three, what I was telling you, the information system.
1373620	1375620	Which was in 2023, 2019.
1375620	1377620	And there is also another one from TI 2023.
1377620	1379620	Here it is.
1379620	1381620	May 2023 TI.
1383620	1385620	And there are also
1385620	1387620	each student.
1387620	1389620	With the code.
1389620	1391620	Because...
1391620	1393620	The code.
1395620	1397620	There is the number of the cell,
1397620	1399620	the electronic code and the career.
1403620	1405620	Information system and technology.
1405620	1407620	You have to associate the code
1407620	1409620	with the mesh.
1409620	1411620	The information system is
1411620	1413620	not the same career, but they are two different meshes.
1415620	1417620	Ok.
1417620	1419620	So there is a table
1419620	1421620	called meshes.
1421620	1423620	They must have one.
1423620	1425620	A cell is a mesh.
1427620	1429620	We have it as a general user.
1429620	1431620	Technology has two meshes.
1431620	1433620	I already think how to put it.
1433620	1435620	As users.
1435620	1437620	Previously we had a user
1437620	1439620	and we managed by roles
1439620	1441620	in another table.
1441620	1443620	By role, director, student,
1443620	1445620	etc.
1445620	1447620	And the INGE told us that it would be
1447620	1449620	to have so many tables.
1449620	1451620	If we could manage everything directly with the permissions
1451620	1453620	and everything from one table.
1459620	1461620	Are you using the inheritance?
1461620	1463620	Yes.
1465620	1467620	I don't know how vulnerable
1467620	1469620	those tables are.
1471620	1473620	And how do you do the registration?
1473620	1475620	How do you do the registration with a...
1475620	1477620	or a teacher?
1477620	1481620	A teacher is a person.
1483620	1485620	Sure. No one asks how a teacher
1485620	1487620	belongs to a student.
1489620	1491620	I'm done.
1491620	1493620	The relationship between student and teacher?
1493620	1495620	Yes.
1495620	1497620	Ok.
1499620	1501620	Because at the beginning we had defined
1501620	1503620	the student table and the teacher table.
1503620	1505620	Teacher, integration, director.
1505620	1507620	There were five different tables.
1507620	1509620	Could it have been...
1509620	1511620	When you use the inheritance part
1511620	1513620	they have common attributes.
1513620	1515620	All of them.
1515620	1517620	But they have different attributes.
1517620	1519620	Each one of them.
1523620	1525620	My question is
1525620	1527620	how do you know
1527620	1529620	which table the student is from?
1529620	1531620	Because there is no
1531620	1533620	one table of the table.
1533620	1535620	But here the table of the student
1535620	1537620	would be related to the user.
1537620	1539620	And I would say which user belongs to which student.
1539620	1541620	But it would not make sense
1541620	1543620	in the relationship between director and student.
1543620	1545620	Exactly.
1545620	1547620	I'm going to correct this.
1547620	1549620	I'm going to check.
1549620	1551620	Sure.
1551620	1553620	Generally when we do a database
1553620	1555620	the relationships
1555620	1557620	have to make sense
1557620	1559620	both from right to left
1559620	1561620	and from left to right.
1561620	1563620	So it shouldn't make sense.
1565620	1567620	That's why I asked
1567620	1569620	how it is related.
1569620	1571620	For example, how do I know
1571620	1573620	that the teacher is giving in the first table
1573620	1575620	and in the second table?
1575620	1577620	How do I know that the student is doing
1577620	1579620	a thesis belonging to the first table
1579620	1581620	or the system table?
1581620	1583620	The excelent one.
1585620	1587620	Sure.
1587620	1589620	One of the tables is missing.
1589620	1591620	The relationship is missing.
1591620	1593620	In the beginning when we did the tables
1593620	1595620	we did separate the roles.
1595620	1597620	We put different things
1597620	1599620	and the common attributes we used as an inheritance.
1599620	1601620	That's true.
1601620	1603620	But then
1603620	1605620	when we did the first revision with Charlie
1605620	1607620	he made some adjustments
1607620	1609620	and explained to us that it was necessary
1609620	1611620	to keep so many tables
1611620	1613620	to manage everything and the roles
1613620	1615620	in one.
1615620	1617620	In one.
1617620	1619620	So we did the revision with him
1619620	1621620	and that's how the tables were.
1621620	1623620	Because in the beginning we had 15 tables.
1629620	1631620	I don't know if we changed the database so much.
1631620	1633620	Since we started the database
1633620	1635620	it was...
1637620	1639620	It was complicated.
1639620	1641620	We'll do it again.
1641620	1643620	We'll do it again.
1643620	1645620	If you start well
1645620	1647620	it's something you're using
1647620	1649620	at some point.
1649620	1651620	At some point.
1651620	1653620	It hasn't been long since you started.
1655620	1657620	But...
1659620	1661620	It's not true.
1661620	1663620	How many attributes do you have in the tables?
1663620	1665620	2, 4, 5, 6.
1665620	1667620	6 attributes.
1669620	1671620	And the roles?
1671620	1673620	The roles are inside the user's table.
1675620	1677620	Of course.
1677620	1679620	In the beginning I used an external table
1679620	1681620	of roles.
1681620	1683620	But when we did the revision
1683620	1685620	he told us that it should be joined.
1685620	1687620	That it shouldn't be separated.
1687620	1689620	So we put it together.
1689620	1691620	But we'll do it again.
1693620	1695620	If you want them to review that part
1695620	1697620	do it in the same way
1697620	1699620	that you did.
1699620	1701620	The wizard works with the director.
1703620	1705620	So review it with the god.
1705620	1707620	If he tells you it's good...
1707620	1709620	Come.
1709620	1711620	If he tells you there's an observation
1711620	1713620	take that observation.
1715620	1717620	Inge, maybe the other week
1717620	1719620	you'll have time to show...
1719620	1721620	Notomar 3?
1721620	1723620	I think so.
1723620	1725620	But come on the 3 and a half
1725620	1727620	because you won't review it.
1727620	1729620	What happens is that they have to send
1729620	1731620	an article...
1731620	1733620	Don't come to the National Theater.
1733620	1735620	Because in the 3rd week
1735620	1737620	they have to send the article.
1737620	1739620	That's why I was supposed to give them
1739620	1741620	to review the mid-hour
1741620	1743620	but they don't have time.
1743620	1745620	But don't come to the 3 and a half.
1745620	1747620	Better because I'm not waiting for you.
1747620	1749620	Okay. Ready.
1749620	1751620	Thanks.
